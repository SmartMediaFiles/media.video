## Overview

`media.video` is a specialized library within the **SmartMediaFiles ecosystem**. Its purpose is to define and categorize all file types and extensions related to video files. This library provides the necessary definitions for the main `@/media` library to recognize and classify video files like `MP4`, `MOV`, `AVI`, etc.

## Features

- **File Type Definitions**: Provides a list of `FileType` constants for each supported video format.
- **File Extension Definitions**: Provides a list of all corresponding `FileExtension` constants.
- **Type-to-Extension Mapping**: Contains the `VideoFileTypesExtensions` map that links each file type to its extensions, which is then consumed by the central `@/media` registry.
- **Future-proofing**: This library will be expanded to include functions for extracting video-specific metadata (e.g., codecs, duration, resolution).
